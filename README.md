# Our Java Project

Based on RMI (Remote Method Invocation) implementation, this project lets the clients communicate among them through a Server.
RMI creates a connection between Client, Shared and Server, so that a client can draw a picture, and the other users/clients can enjoy guessing the correct corrisponding word.

- When a user enters the game, he/she will wait for the other user to join, so that they can play together.

- The Client that has temporary command is able to see the word and has some seconds to draw it as he/she wants to, using colors and the pad available.

- The others gamers have the goal to guess the right word corresponding to the picture that they see.
  The Client's control of drawing and guessing switches every round.
  The first one to guess will get 50 points; the second 40, and the third 35 points.

- The winner is the one who has accumulated more points at the end of the game.
